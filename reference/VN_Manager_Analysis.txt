19. modules/vnmanager/utils/asset_selector.js
   * Design Philosophy: Ease of use
     A user can just drag & drop his songs (Happy.wav), backgrounds (Forest.png) and sprites (Laura_Happy.png) and the system
     will process it all through the context in the file name. No need for manual complicated configurations.
   * Purpose: Selects the most appropriate background image and background music (OST) for a given scene
     description. It can use LLM-based reasoning and/or vector similarity search for OST selection.
   * Main Functions:
       * selectBestBackground(sceneDescription, backgrounds, callLlm): Prompts an LLM to choose the best background from a list of filenames. It respects the `settings.assetSelector.enableBackground` setting.
       * createBackgroundSelectionPrompt(scene, filenames): Creates the LLM prompt for background selection.
       * findMatchingBackground(response, backgrounds, filenames): Parses the LLM response to find the matching background filename.
       * getVectorStoreForOST(cacheKey, ostList): Initializes and caches a ChromaDB vector store for OST filenames.
       * performVectorSearch(sceneDescription, ostList, cacheKey): Performs similarity search on OST filenames to get relevant candidates.
       * mapVectorSearchResults(results, ostList): Maps vector search results back to original OST file paths.
       * selectBestOST(sceneDescription, ostList, useVectorSearch, cacheKey, callLlm): Prompts an LLM to choose the best OST from a list, optionally pre-filtering candidates using vector search. It respects the `settings.assetSelector.enableOST` setting.
       * createOSTSelectionPrompt(sceneDescription, candidates): Creates the LLM prompt for OST selection.
       * findMatchingOST(response, ostList): Parses the LLM response to find the matching OST filename.
   * Modularity: High. Focused on asset selection.
   * Dependencies: utils.js (for openrouterRequest, getFilename, Logger, readSettings), @langchain/community/vectorstores/chroma, @langchain/ollama, path.
   * Flow Analysis: Called by `vnmanager.js` during the VN transformation process.


  20. modules/vnmanager/utils/dialogue_processor.js

       * isValidCharacterName(character): Validates if a string is a plausible character name (e.g., not too long, no verbs).
       * cleanTtsText(text): Cleans text for TTS by removing parenthetical notes and extra whitespace.
       * sanitizeForCrc(str): Sanitizes text for CRC calculation by replacing special characters.
       * requestTtsGeneration(scriptText, socket): Sends a payload to an external TTS API endpoint (`settings.ttsApiEndpoint`) for audio generation. It respects the `settings.enableTTS` setting and emits `vn-tts-complete` or `vn-tts-error` events via the provided socket.
       * createDialogueTransformPrompt(text): Creates an LLM prompt to format text into VN dialogue. It uses `uncensorify.txt` if `settings.useUncensorifyPrompt` is true.
       * processDialogueLines(text, callLlm, socket): The main function:
           * Calls an LLM (via `callLlm`) to transform the text into VN dialogue format.
           * Asynchronously initiates TTS generation via `requestTtsGeneration`.
           * Parses the LLM's output to identify dialogue lines and characters for emotion classification.
   * Modularity: High. Focused on dialogue formatting and TTS integration.
   * Dependencies: utils.js (for Logger, readSettings), axios, crc-32, fs, path.
   * Flow Analysis: Called by `vnmanager.js` as the first step in VN transformation. It's responsible for
      structuring the raw story text into VN commands and initiating TTS.


  21. modules/vnmanager/utils/emotion_classifier.js


   * Purpose: Classifies the emotional state of characters based on their dialogue. It extracts possible
     emotions from sprite filenames and uses an LLM to predict the most suitable emotion for each dialogue
     line.

       * parseSimpleChoices(responseText): Parses a simple numbered list response from the LLM into an array of choice objects with default properties.
       * generatePlayerChoices(sceneText, callLlm, options): The main function to generate player choices. It uses a random roll to determine the type of choices to generate (free-form input, simple numbered list, or structured JSON with risk/reward analysis). It calls the LLM (`callLlm`) with a tailored prompt based on the chosen type. The choices can be generated with archetypes such as Brave/Direct, Cautious/Observant, Clever/Diplomatic, Evil, Neutral/Observant, Good/Positive, Flirty/Direct, or Mature/Intimate.
   * Modularity: High. Focused on player choice generation.
   * Dependencies: utils.js (for Logger).

     been identified. It adds the sprites (left, center, right) property to each command in the sequence.

  26. modules/vnmanager/vnmanager.js (Visual Novel Transformation Orchestrator)

   * Purpose: This module orchestrates the entire process of transforming raw story text and chapter data into a complete visual novel turn. **It operates by receiving and populating a `TurnContext` object, coordinating various sub-modules to handle asset selection (backgrounds, OSTs), emotion classification, sprite arrangement, player choice generation, and integration of orchestrator feedback. The `TurnContext` object serves as the central data capsule for this entire process, ensuring all relevant information is accessible and consistently managed.**

   * Main Functions:
       * processedLines(outputLines, dialoguesToClassify, sprites, mainCharacter): Processes dialogue lines, classifies emotions, and finds sprites for each line.
       * transformVNProject(turnContext): The main function that orchestrates the VN transformation pipeline. **It receives a `TurnContext` object, which contains all necessary input (story text, project assets, etc.) and is populated with the generated VN sequence and other processed data. It runs various sub-processes in parallel, leveraging the `TurnContext` for streamlined data access and updates, including:**
           * Initializing Fact Manager.
           * Processing dialogue lines (`dialogue_processor.processDialogueLines`).
           * Conditionally running the periodic orchestrator (`orchestrator.runPeriodic`).
           * Selecting best background (`asset_selector.selectBestBackground`).
           * Selecting best OST (`asset_selector.selectBestOST`).
           * Generating player choices (`player_choice_generator.generatePlayerChoices`).
           * Extracting and storing facts (`fact_manager.extractAndStoreFacts`).
           * Computing sprite positions (`sprite_positioner.computeSpritePositions`).
           * Reports progress via socket.

   * Modularity: High. It acts as an orchestrator, delegating specific tasks to its utility sub-modules.

   * Dependencies: `../utils.js` (for `openrouterRequest`, `readSettings`, `TurnLogger`, `Logger`, `reportProgressUtil`), `socket.io-client`, `./utils/asset_selector.js`, `./utils/emotion_classifier.js`, `./utils/sprite_finder.js`, `./utils/sprite_positioner.js`, `./utils/dialogue_processor.js`, `../orchestrator.js`, `./utils/player_choice_generator.js`, `./utils/fact_manager.js`.

   * Flow Analysis:
       1. Trigger: `transformVNProject` is called by `main.js` (specifically `vnHandlers.generateVNTurn`), **receiving the `TurnContext` object as its primary input.**
       2. Initialization: Initializes the Fact Manager for the project.
       3. Dialogue Processing: Calls `dialogue_processor.processDialogueLines` to structure the raw text.
       4. Parallel Processing: Concurrently executes:
           * `processedLines` (which in turn calls `emotion_classifier.batchClassifyEmotions` and `sprite_finder.findSprite`).
           * `asset_selector.selectBestBackground`.
           * `asset_selector.selectBestOST`.
           * `player_choice_generator.generatePlayerChoices`.
           * `orchestrator.runPeriodic` (conditionally, based on `VN_MANAGER_CONFIG.ORCHESTRATOR_INTERVAL`). **The `TurnContext` object is passed to the orchestrator, providing it with all necessary context for its analysis.**
           * `fact_manager.extractAndStoreFacts`.
       5. Sprite Positioning: After `processedLines` completes, `sprite_positioner.computeSpritePositions` is called to determine on-screen sprite placement.
       6. Result: Returns a comprehensive object containing the final VN sequence, selected background, song, player choices, and orchestrator feedback for rendering in the UI. **All these results are encapsulated within the `TurnContext` object, ensuring a single, consistent output for the entire turn.**
       7. Progress Reporting: Uses `reportProgressUtil` to send progress updates to the renderer via a socket.
