Log Viewer Analysis:

This document outlines the functionality and implementation details of the Log Viewer component.

Purpose:
The Log Viewer provides a user interface to display application logs, aiding in debugging, monitoring, and cost analysis of LLM interactions.

Files Involved:
- `views/log_viewer/logs.html`: The HTML structure for the log viewer UI.
- `views/log_viewer/renderer_logs.js`: The renderer process script responsible for fetching, processing, and displaying logs, including cost calculations.
- `views/log_viewer/style.css`: Styling for the log viewer UI, including new themes and cost visualization.
- `main.js`: Handles the backend logic for reading log files and sending them to the renderer process, as well as providing model pricing information, now sourced from the multi-provider LLM configuration.

Workflow:
1.  User navigates to the "Log Viewer" tab in the main application window.
2.  `main.js` loads `logs.html` into a new webview.
3.  `renderer_logs.js` (loaded by `logs.html`) initializes the UI and establishes a Socket.IO connection to `main.js`.
4.  Upon connection, `renderer_logs.js` requests the current project name and model pricing from `main.js`.
5.  `renderer_logs.js` emits a `get-all-logs` event to `main.js` for the current project.
6.  `main.js` receives the `get-all-logs` event, reads the log files from the `logs/` directory (e.g., `messages_*.json`, `orchestrator_*.json`).
7.  `main.js` processes the log data (e.g., parsing JSON, formatting for display) and sends it back to `renderer_logs.js` via a `get-all-logs-response` event.
8.  `renderer_logs.js` receives the log data and dynamically updates the `logs.html` to:
    *   Display a list of log files.
    *   When a log file header is clicked, it requests the content of that specific log file via `get-log-content`.
    *   Upon receiving log content, it calculates estimated LLM costs (input/output tokens, duration) based on the provided multi-provider model pricing, which now accounts for different LLM services and their respective cost structures.
    *   It renders a hierarchical cost bar chart and detailed tables breaking down costs by model and by topic.
    *   It displays individual log entries (requests and responses) in an expandable format.
9.  The system also supports real-time updates: `main.js` can emit a `project-changed` event if the active project changes, or `new-log-available` if new log entries are written, prompting `renderer_logs.js` to refresh the display.

Key Features:
-   **Dynamic Log Loading:** Loads logs for the currently active project.
-   **Expandable Log Files:** Users can click on log file headers to expand/collapse their contents.
-   **Detailed Log Entries:** Displays individual LLM requests and responses, including timestamps and payloads.
-   **Interactive JSON Tree View:** Displays JSON payloads in an interactive, collapsible tree format.
-   **Themed JSON Tree Styling:** Integrates visually with the application's theme using CSS variables.
-   **Formatted String Display:** Ensures string values within the JSON tree display with proper line breaks and word wrapping.
-   **Functional Expand/Collapse Icons:** Provides clear visual cues and interaction for expanding and collapsing JSON tree nodes.
-   **LLM Cost Analysis:** Estimates and visualizes LLM token usage and costs per model and per topic, now supporting multiple LLM providers.
-   **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays the duration of LLM interactions.
-   **Real-time Updates:** Automatically refreshes logs when the project changes or new logs are available.
-   **Themed UI:** Incorporates custom fonts and a Genshin-themed aesthetic with improved scrollbars and visual elements.
