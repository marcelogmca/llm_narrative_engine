World Builder Analysis:

This document outlines the functionality and implementation details of the World Builder component.

Purpose:
The World Builder provides a user interface for creating, editing, and managing world-related data within the application. This could include locations, characters, lore, events, and other narrative elements.

Files Involved:
- `views/world_builder/world_builder.html`: The HTML structure for the world builder UI.
- `views/world_builder/renderer_world.js`: The renderer process script responsible for handling user interactions and communicating with the main process.
- `views/world_builder/world_builder.css`: Styling for the world builder UI.
- `main.js`: Handles the backend logic for persisting world data (e.g., saving to and loading from JSON files or a database).

Workflow:
1. User navigates to the "World Builder" tab in the main application window.
2. `main.js` loads `world_builder.html` into a new webview.
3. `renderer_world.js` (loaded by `world_builder.html`) initializes the UI and establishes a Socket.IO connection to `main.js`.
4. User interacts with the World Builder UI to create or modify world data (e.g., adding a new character, defining a location).
5. `renderer_world.js` sends events to `main.js` (e.g., `save-world-data`, `load-world-data`) to persist or retrieve data.
6. `main.js` receives these events and performs the necessary file system operations (e.g., writing JSON to a file, reading from a file).
7. `main.js` sends responses back to `renderer_world.js` (e.g., `world-data-saved`, `world-data-loaded`) to update the UI accordingly.
8. The World Builder UI dynamically updates to reflect the changes or loaded data.
